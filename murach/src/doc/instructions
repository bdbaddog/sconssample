1. Start the DBMS on your DBMS server $HOST, please refer to 
   openkicks_ins.txt (step 3) on how to install and start the DBMS.
   Please use the following command to test if the DBMS is ready:
      psql -h $HOST -d okdb_$USER
   If it is not ready, please also refer to openkicks_ins.txt for details.
   
   Or you can test the DBMS with:
      $OKDIR/bin/okstartdb
   If the DBMS is not ready, okstartdb will try to start it


2. Configure your $OKDIR/etc/DFHSIT.txt for openkicks
   File format:
      UserName,SystemID,Host,Region,3270 Port,Https Port,Database Vendor,Database@DatabaseHost,    Cobol Vendor,Charset, SecurityModel
   Exmample:
      jason,   test,    test,$REGION,3270,    8080,      postgres,        okdb_jason@192.168.0.254,test,        iso88591,ru


3. Add database items to the "transaction" table:
   psql -h $HOST -d okdb_$USER -f $OKREGION/murach/src/rdo/murach.sql


4. Now you can view these items through web browser
   $OKDIR/bin/oktcpd
   http://192.168.0.100:$"Https Port"


5. Start ok3270d
   make install
   $OKDIR/bin/ok3270d


6. Now you can connect to ok3270d with x3270
   x3270 -> 192.168.0.100:$"3270 Port"
   And you can type the TransID to start the corresponding program
